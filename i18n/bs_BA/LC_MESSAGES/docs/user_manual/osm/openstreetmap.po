msgid "In recent years, the OpenStreetMap project has gained popularity because in many countries no free geodata such as digital roadmaps are available. The objective of the OSM project is to create a free editable map of the world from GPS data, aerial photography or from local knowledge. To support this objective, QGIS provides a plugin that enables its users to work with OSM data."
