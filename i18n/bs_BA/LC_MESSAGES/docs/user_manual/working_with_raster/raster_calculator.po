msgid "In the **Result layer** section you have to define an output layer. You can then define the extent of the calculation area based on an input raster layer or based on X,Y coordinates and on Columns and Rows to set the resolution of the output layer. If the input layer has a different resolution, the values will be resampled with nearest neighbor algorithm."
