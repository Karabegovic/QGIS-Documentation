msgid "The *Toolbox* is the main element of the SEXTANTE GUI, and the one that you are more likely to use in your daily work. It shows the list of all available algorithms grouped in different blocks, and is the access point to run them whether as a single process or as a batch process involving several executions of a same algorithm on different sets of inputs."

msgid "The toolbox contains all the algorithms available, divided into groups. Each group represents a so-called algorithm provider, which is a set of algorithms coming from the same source, for instance, from a third-party application with geoprocessing capabilities. Some of this groups represent algorithms from one of such third-party applications (like SAGA, GRASS or R), while other contain algorithms directly coded along with SEXTANTE elements, not relying on any additional software. Currently, these providers all reuse code from already-existing QGIS plugins (more specifically, from the *fTools* vector library shipped along with QGIS and the contributed *mmqgis* plugin that you can install using the plugin manager), making them more useful, since they can be executed from elements such as the modeler or the batch processing interface, which we will soon describe."
