msgid "SEXTANTE algorithms (including models) can be executed as a batch process. That is, they can be executed using not a single set of inputs, but several of them, executing the algorithm as many times as needed. This is useful when processing large amounts of data, since it is not necessary to launch the algorithm many times from the toolbox."

msgid "Executing a batch process is similar to performing a single execution of an algorithm. Parameter values have to be defined, but in this case we need not just a single value for each parameter, but a set of them instead, one for each time the algorithm has to be executed. Values are introduced using a table like the one shown next."

msgid "Each line of this table represents a single execution of the algorithm, and each cell contains the value of one of the parameters. It is similar to the parameters dialog that you see when executing an algorithm from the toolbox, but with a different arrangement."

msgid "The main differences are found for parameters representing layers or tables, and for output filepaths. Regarding input layers and tables, when an algorithm is executed as part of a batch process those input data objects are taken directly from files, and not from the set of them already opened in QGIS. For this reason, any algorithm can be executed as a batch process even if no data objects at all are opened and the algorithm cannot be run from the toolbox."

msgid "Filenames for input data objects are introduced directly typing or, more conveniently, clicking on the button on the right hand of the cell, which shows a typical file chooser dialog. Multiple files can be selected at once. If the input parameter represents a single data object and several files are selected, each one of them will be put in a separate row, adding new ones if needed. If it represents a multiple input, all the selected files will be added to a single cell, separated by semicolons."

msgid "If the default value (*Do not autocomplete*) is selected, SEXTANTE will just put the selected filename in the selected cell from the parameters table. If any of the other options is selected, all the cells below the selected one will be automatically filled based on a defined criteria. This way, it is much easier to fill the table, and the batch process can be defined with less effort."
