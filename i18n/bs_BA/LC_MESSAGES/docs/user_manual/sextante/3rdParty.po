Algorithms relying on an external application are managed by their own algorithm provider."

In most cases, it can read what you have opened in QGIS, but in some cases, that might not be the case. When using databases or uncommon file formats, whether for raster of vector layers, problems might arise. If that happens, try to use well known file formats that you are sure that are understood by both programs, and check to console output (in the history and log dialog) for knowing more about what is going wrong."

msgid "By default, SEXTANTE tries to configure its GRASS connector to use the GRASS distribution that ships along with QGIS. This should work without problems in most systems, but if you experience problems, you might have to do it manually. Also, if you want to use a different GRASS version, you can change that setting and point to the folder where that other version is kept. GRASS 6.4 is needed for algorithms to work correctly."
