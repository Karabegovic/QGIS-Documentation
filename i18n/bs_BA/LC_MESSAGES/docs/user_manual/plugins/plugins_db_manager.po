msgid "The DB Manager Plugin is officially part of |qg| core and intends to replace the SPIT Plugin and the PostGIS Manager Plugin and additionally to integrate all other database formats supported by |qg| in one user interface. The |icon_dbmanager| :sup:`DB Manager` Plugin provides several features. You can drag layers from the QGIS Browser into the DB Manager and it will import your layer into your spatial database. You can drag and drop tables between spatial databases and they will get imported. You can also use the DB Manager to execute SQL queries against your spatial database and then view the spatial output for queries by adding the results to QGIS as a query layer."

msgid "The **Database** menu allows to connect to an existing database, to start the SQL-window and to exit the DB Manager Plugin. The **Schema** menu includes tools to create and delete (empty) schemas and, if topology is available (e.g. PostGIS 2) to start a TopoViewer. The menu **Table** allows to create and edit tables and to delete tables and views. It is also possible to empty tables and to move tables from one to another schema. Finally you can also run Vacuum Analyze and add Versioning Support to a table."

msgid "If connected to a database, the **main** window of the DB Manager offers three tabs. The :guilabel:`Info` tab provides information about the table and its geometry as well as about existing Fields, Constraints and Indexes. It also allows to run Vacuum Analyze and to create a spatial index on a selected table, if not already done. The :guilabel:`Table` tab shows all attributes and the :guilabel:`Preview` tab renders the geometries as preview."
