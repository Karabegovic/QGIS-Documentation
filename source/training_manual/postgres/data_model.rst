|LS| Implementing the Data Model
===============================================================================

Now that we've covered all the theory, let's create a new database. This
database will be used for our exercises for the lessons that will follow
afterwards.

**The goal for this lesson:** To install the required software and use it to
implement our example database.

Install PostgreSQL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under Ubuntu:

::

  sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.1

You should get a message like this:

::

  [sudo] password for timlinux: 
  Reading package lists... Done
  Building dependency tree       
  Reading state information... Done
  The following extra packages will be installed:
  postgresql-client-9.1 postgresql-client-common postgresql-common
  Suggested packages:
  oidentd ident-server postgresql-doc-9.1
  The following NEW packages will be installed:
  postgresql-9.1 postgresql-client-9.1 postgresql-client-common postgresql-common
  0 upgraded, 4 newly installed, 0 to remove and 5 not upgraded.
  Need to get 5,012kB of archives.
  After this operation, 19.0MB of additional disk space will be used.
  Do you want to continue [Y/n]? 

Press :kbd:`Y` and :kbd:`Enter` and wait for the download and installation to
finish.

Help
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PostgreSQL has very good `online
<http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/index.html>`_ documentation. 

Create a database user
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under Ubuntu:

After the installation is complete, run this command to become the postgres
user and then create a new database user:

::

  sudo su - postgres

Type in your normal log in password when prompted (you need to have sudo rights).

Now, at the postgres user's bash prompt, create the database user. Make sure
the user name matches your unix login name: it will make your life much easier,
as postgres will automatically authenticate you when you are logged in as that
user.

::

  createuser -d -E -i -l -P -r -s timlinux

Enter a password when prompted. I normally use a different password to my usual
unix login.

What do those options mean?

::

  -d, --createdb     role can create new databases
  -E, --encrypted    encrypt stored password
  -i, --inherit      role inherits privileges of roles it is a member of (default)
  -l, --login        role can login (default)
  -P, --pwprompt     assign a password to new role
  -r, --createrole   role can create new roles
  -s, --superuser    role will be superuser

Now you should should leave the postgres user's bash shell environment by
typing:

::

  exit

Verify the new account
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

  psql -l

Should return something like this:

::

  timlinux@linfiniti:~$ psql -l
  List of databases
  Name      |  Owner   | Encoding | Collation  |   Ctype    |   
  ----------+----------+----------+------------+------------+
  postgres  | postgres | UTF8     | en_ZA.utf8 | en_ZA.utf8 | 
  template0 | postgres | UTF8     | en_ZA.utf8 | en_ZA.utf8 |
  template1 | postgres | UTF8     | en_ZA.utf8 | en_ZA.utf8 |
  (3 rows)

Type :kbd:`q` to exit.

Create a database
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The :kbd:`createdb` command is used to create a new database. It should be run
from the bash shell prompt.

::

  createdb address

You can verify the existence of your new database by using this command:

::

  psql -l

Which should return something like this:

::

  List of databases
  Name      |  Owner   | Encoding | Collation  |   Ctype    |   Access privileges   
  ----------+----------+----------+------------+------------+-----------------------
  address   | timlinux | UTF8     | en_ZA.utf8 | en_ZA.utf8 | 
  postgres  | postgres | UTF8     | en_ZA.utf8 | en_ZA.utf8 | 
  template0 | postgres | UTF8     | en_ZA.utf8 | en_ZA.utf8 | =c/postgres: postgres=CTc/postgres
  template1 | postgres | UTF8     | en_ZA.utf8 | en_ZA.utf8 | =c/postgres: postgres=CTc/postgres
  (4 rows)

Type :kbd:`q` to exit.

Starting a database shell session
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can connect to your database easily like this:

::

  psql address

To exit out of the psql database shell, type:

::

  \q

For help in using the shell, type:

::

  \?

For help in using sql commands, type:

::

  \help

To get help on a specific command, type (for example):

::

  \help create table

See also the `Psql cheat sheet </static/training_manual/postgres/psql_cheatsheet.pdf>`_ -
available online `here
<http://www.postgresonline.com/special_feature.php?sf_name=postgresql83_psql_cheatsheet&outputformat=html>`_.

Make Tables in SQL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's start making some tables! We will use our ER Diagram as a guide. First,
let's create a streets table:

::

  create table streets (id serial not null primary key, name varchar(50));

:kbd:`serial` and :kbd:`varchar` are **data types**. :kbd:`serial` tells
PostgreSQL to start an integer sequence (autonumber) to populate the :kbd:`id`
automatically for every new record. :kbd:`varchar(50)` tells PostgreSQL to
create a character field of 50 characters in length. 

You will notice that the command ends with a :kbd:`;` - all SQL commands should
be terminated this way. When you press enter, psql will report something like
this:

::

  NOTICE:  CREATE TABLE will create implicit sequence "streets_id_seq" for
           serial column "streets.id"
  NOTICE:  CREATE TABLE / PRIMARY KEY will create implicit index "streets_pkey"
           for table "streets"
  CREATE TABLE

That means your table was created successfully, with a primary key :kbd:`streets_pkey`
using :kbd:`streets.id`.

Note: If you hit return without entering a :kbd:`;`, then you will get a prompt like
this: :kbd:`address-#`. This is because PG is expecting you to enter more. Enter
:kbd:`;` to run your command.

To view your table schema, you can do this:

::

  \d streets

Which should show something like this:

::

  Table "public.streets"
   Column |         Type          |            Modifiers                       
  --------+-----------------------+--------------------------------------
   id     | integer               | not null default 
          |                       | nextval('streets_id_seq'::regclass)
   name   | character varying(50) | 
  Indexes:
    "streets_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)

To view your table contents, you can do this:

::

  select * from streets;

Which should show something like this:

::

   id | name 
   ---+------
   (0 rows)

As you can see, our table is empty!

Use the approach shown above to make a table called people:
Add fields such as phone number, home address, name, etc. (these aren't all valid names: change them to make them valid).

  Write the SQL you create here:

Solution:

::

  create table people (id serial not null primary key, 
                       name varchar(50), 
                       house_no int not null, 
                       street_id int not null, 
                       phone_no varchar null );

The schema for the table (enter :kbd:`\\d people`) looks like this:

::

  Table "public.people"
  Column     |         Type          |                      Modifiers                      
  -----------+-----------------------+-------------------------------------
  id         | integer               | not null default 
             |                       | nextval('people_id_seq'::regclass)
  name       | character varying(50) | 
  house_no   | integer               | not null
  street_id  | integer               | not null
  phone_no   | character varying     | 
  Indexes:
    "people_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)

.. note::  For illustration purposes, we have purposely omitted the fkey
   constraint.

Create Keys in SQL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The problem with our solution above is that the database doesn't know that
people and streets have a logical relationship. To express this relationship,
we have to define a foreign key that points to the primary key of the streets
table.

.. image:: /static/training_manual/postgres/er-beispiel.png
   :align: center

There are two ways to do this: 
 - adding the key after the table has been created
 - defining the key at time of table creation

Our table has already been created, so let's do it the first way:

::

  alter table people 
    add constraint people_streets_fk foreign key (street_id) references streets(id);


That tells the :kbd:`people` table that its :kbd:`street_id` fields must match
a valid street :kbd:`id` from the :kbd:`streets` table.

The more usual way to create a constraint is to do it when you create the table:

::

  create table people (id serial not null primary key, 
                       name varchar(50), 
                       house_no int not null, 
                       street_id int references streets(id) not null, 
                       phone_no varchar null);

After adding the constraint, our table schema looks like this now:

::

  \d people
  Table "public.people"
    Column   |         Type          |            Modifiers                      
  -----------+-----------------------+---------------------------------
   id        | integer               | not null default 
             |                       | nextval('people_id_seq'::regclass)
   name      | character varying(50) | 
   house_no  | integer               | not null
   street_id | integer               | not null
   phone_no  | character varying     | 
  Indexes:
    "people_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
  Foreign-key constraints:
    "people_streets_fk" FOREIGN KEY (id) REFERENCES streets(id)

Create Indexes in SQL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We want lightning fast searches on peoples names. To provide for this, we can
create an index on the name column of our people table:

::

  create index people_name_idx on people(name);

::

  address=# \d people
  Table "public.people"
    Column   |         Type          |                      Modifiers                      
  -----------+-----------------------+-----------------------------------
   id        | integer               | not null default nextval
             |                       | ('people_id_seq'::regclass)
   name      | character varying(50) | 
   house_no  | integer               | not null
   street_id | integer               | not null
   phone_no  | character varying     | 
  Indexes:
   "people_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
   "people_name_idx" btree (name)    <-- new index added!
  Foreign-key constraints:
   "people_streets_fk" FOREIGN KEY (id) REFERENCES streets(id)

Dropping Tables in SQL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to get rid of a table you can use the :kbd:`drop` command:

::

  drop table streets;


In our example, this would not work - why?

  Some deep and inspired thoughts as to why...

Sometimes you just can't stand having a table any more. Maybe you are sick of
all your friends. How can you get rid of them all in one easy step? Drop the
table of course! Of course, right now too much hard work has gone into our
table to get rid of it on a whim, but if you really hate your friends that
much, nothing's stopping you from ridding yourself of them forever:

::

  drop table people;

This time it works fine! Why? Are people less important than streets?

  Some thoughts on why you could drop people:

.. note::  If you actually did enter that command and dropped the :kbd:`people`
   table, now would be a good time to rebuild it, as you will need it in the
   next exercises.

A word on PG Admin III
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are showing you the SQL commands from the psql prompt because it's a very
useful way to learn about databases. However, there are quicker and easier ways
to do a lot of what we are showing you. Install PGAdminIII and you can create,
drop, alter etc tables using 'point and click' operations in a GUI.

Under Ubuntu, you can install it like this:

::

  sudo apt-get install pgadmin3
