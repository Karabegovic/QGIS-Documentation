|LS| Installing and Managing Plugins
===============================================================================

To begin using plugins, you need to know how to download, install and activate
them. To do this, you will learn how to use the :guilabel:`Plugin Installer`
and :guilabel:`Plugin Manager`.

**The goal for this lesson:** To understand and use QGIS' plugin system.

|basic| |FA| Managing Plugins
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* To open the :guilabel:`Plugin Manager`, click on the menu item
  :menuselection:`Plugins --> Manage Plugins`.
* In the dialog that opens, find the :guilabel:`GdalTools` plugin:

     :align: center

* Click in the box next to this plugin and uncheck it.
* Click :guilabel:`OK`.
* Look under the :guilabel:`Raster` menu. You will see that many of the
  functions you have been using before have disappeared! This is because they
  are part of the :guilabel:`GdalTools` plugin, which needs to be activated for
  you to use them.
* Open the :guilabel:`Plugin Manager` again and reactivate the
  :guilabel:`GdalTools` plugin by clicking in the checkbox next to it.
* If you open the :guilabel:`Raster` menu again, you'll see that the tools have
  reappeared.

Importantly, however, the list of plugins that you can activate and deactivate
only draws from the plugins that you currently have installed. To install new
plugins, you need to use the :guilabel:`Plugin Installer`.

|basic| |FA| Installing New Plugins
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* To start the :guilabel:`Plugin Installer`, click on the menu item
  :menuselection:`Plugins --> Fetch Python Plugins`.

A dialog will appear. The amount of plugins that you see here will differ,
depending on your setup.

The plugins that are available to you for installation depend on which
*repositories* you are checking.

QGIS plugins are stored online in repositories. By default, only the official
repositories are active, meaning that you can only access official plugins.
These are usually the first plugins you want, because they have been tested
thoroughly and are often included in QGIS by default.

It is possible, however, to try out more plugins than the default ones. First,
you want to check in all available repositories. To do this:

* Open the :guilabel:`Repositories` tab on the :guilabel:`Plugin Installer`
  dialog:
  
  .. image:: /static/training_manual/qgis_plugins/002.png
     :align: center

* Click the :guilabel:`Add 3rd party repositories` button. A disclaimer will
  appear.
* Click :guilabel:`OK` to find and add these extra repositories:

  .. image:: /static/training_manual/qgis_plugins/003.png
     :align: center

However, even with these extra repositories enabled, you won't see the plugins
that they contain, unless you allow these plugins to be displayed.

* Open the :guilabel:`Options` tab:

  .. image:: /static/training_manual/qgis_plugins/004.png
     :align: center

* Select the option :guilabel:`Show all plugins except those marked as
  experimental`.
* If you now switch back to the :guilabel:`Plugins` tab, you will see that many
  more plugins are now available for installation.
* To install a plugin, simply click on it in the list and then click the
  :guilabel:`Install plugin` button.
